Random walks are important but do not have efficient implementations,
or unsufficient API.

Especially relevant for SPARQL since we often have all indexes.

We limit ourself to a subset of SPARQL for now. We do not process
property paths although it would be possible. Optionals, set minus, are
difficult.

\todo{MUST shoot a short video to showcase \NAME. And link it.}

Random walks enable few use-cases (from most easy to most demanding)
such as:
\begin{asparadesc}
\item [pyRDF2Vec~\cite{steenwinckel2023pyrdf2vec}] needs random walks.
\item [FedUP] needs the graphs of random walks.
\item [Join ordering~\REF] needs cardinalities of random walks.
\item [Sparklis~\cite{ferre2017sparklis}] needs random walks (at
  least) and cardinality (optional).
\item [Wander Join~\cite{li2016wanderjoin}] needs the cardinality of
  random walks, failed and succeeded.
\end{asparadesc}
