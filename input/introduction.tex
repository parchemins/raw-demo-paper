Random walks are important but do not have efficient implementations,
or unsufficient API. More importantly, they are precluded to servers
and they do not let outsiders use them.

Could go for triple/quad patterns and it would be enough. But the more
we push to server the more efficient.

Especially relevant for SPARQL since we often have all indexes.

We limit ourself to a subset of SPARQL for now. We do not process
property paths although it would be possible. Optionals, set minus, are
difficult.

Random walks enable few use-cases (from most easy to most demanding)
such as:
\begin{asparadesc}
\item [Summaries] needs random walk values.
\item [pyRDF2Vec~\cite{steenwinckel2023pyrdf2vec}] needs random walk values.
\item [FedUP] needs the graphs of random walks.
\item [Join ordering~\REF] needs cardinalities of random walks.
\item [Sparklis~\cite{ferre2017sparklis}] needs random walks (at
  least) and cardinality (optional).
\item [Wander Join~\cite{li2016wanderjoin}] needs the cardinality of
  random walks, failed and succeeded.
\end{asparadesc}
