Sampling-based Approximate Query Processing (S-AQP) drastically reduces query
execution time by delivering approximated results with error
estimates~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/AgarwalMKTJMMS14}. S-AQP has many important use cases in RDF, including
computing large-scale statistics~\cite{soulet2019anytime,10.1007/978-3-319-18818-8_14},
embeddings with random walks~\cite{ristoski2016rdf2vec}, join
orderings for query optimization~\cite{DBLP:conf/cidr/LeisRGK017},
approximate
aggregations~\cite{wang2022approximate},
summaries~\cite{10.1007/978-3-030-49461-2_10}, and exploratory
queries~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/AgarwalMKTJMMS14}.
%
However, current SPARQL endpoints have no native support for S-AQP,
leaving end-users with no choice but to materialize and then sample
results. In other words, sampling has the same cost as evaluating a
SPARQL query, the latter having no guarantee of completion on public
SPARQL endpoints due to fair-use policies. 
% Consequently, sampling has at least the same cost as evaluating
% SPARQL queries, which time out on public SPARQL endpoints.
%
For example, one could draw random triples from Wikidata~\cite{soulet2019anytime}
by repeatedly executing \lstinline[language=SPARQL]|SELECT * {?s ?p ?o} OFFSET r LIMIT 1|,
where $r$ is a random number between $0$ and
the size of the dataset ($0<r<12B$). However, when $r > 100M$ queries time out on Wikidata.
%Hala: random sampling from the set of results matched by a particular SPARQL triple pattern
Some triple stores propose ad-hoc methods for sampling
triple patterns\footnote{\url{https://docs.stardog.com/query-stardog/sampling-service\#sampling-service.}}
\footnote{\url{https://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/rndsalltr/}},
but these are limited to single triple patterns and the
underlying complexity is not established. In the SPARQL specification, there is nothing
equivalent to the \texttt{TABLESAMPLE} clause, which has been part of the SQL
standard since 2003. This is a major issue, especially when building an ecosystem based on SPARQL endpoints. With no S-AQP support
on SPARQL endpoints, building summaries directly from SPARQL endpoints, such as VoID descriptions, is challenging, as well as computing graph
embeddings or optimizing join orders for federated queries.

% From the state of art~\cite{DBLP:conf/cidr/LeisRGK017}, we know that
% is possible to draw a random triple from a triple pattern in
% logarithmic time using the internal index of a TripleStore. Extending
% to BGP support just multiply this complexity by the number of triple
% pattern in the query. Sampling queries makes sense only if the
% approximation error can also be estimated ie. for a query

  In this demonstration, we extended JENA to efficiently support
  S-AQP for conjunctive 
  SPARQL queries. Given a SPARQL query $Q$ and a budget in time,
  \NAME~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Chat-Wane/raw-jena}} delivers random results along with an estimate of the
  total number of results. Our approach relies on random
 walks as defined in \WANDER~\cite{li2019wanderjoin}. 
 This approach has proven to be accurate on the G-Care
 benchmark for RDF datasets~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/ParkKBKHH20}. Thanks
 to traditional SPO, POS, and OSP indexes that are widely used to index RDF data,
 \NAME computes a random walk in $\mathcal{k.log(|G|)}$ for conjunctive queries where
 $k$ is the number of triple patterns in the query and $|G|$ the size
 of the dataset. Thanks to the random walk approach, \NAME converges
 to complete results, i.e., sampling the query multiple times eventually
 returns all results, and the estimated cardinality eventually converges
 to the exact cardinality.

 \noindent For the demonstration, we load the Wikidata
 Benchmark~\cite{angles2022wdbench} of 1,2 billion triples in \NAME, and
 re-execute queries that time out with S-AQP as explained in
 Section~\ref{proposal}. 
 
 %Hala
 The S-AQP results shed light on the reasons for these queries time out and provide users with valuable  information about
% Thanks to S-AQP results, users can understand
% why these queries time out. Overall, this demonstration highlights
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
\item the benefits of S-AQP for the public SPARQL endpoints ecosystem,
\item the feasibility of implementation on well-known engines.
\end{inparaenum}

% - There's nothing about fair use policies?
% - There's just a little about how to guarantee logarithmic time complexity for triple pattern sampling.
%   In the conclusion it's written that "\NAME demonstrates how S-AQP can be easily integrated into a
%   representative SPARQL endpoint" but this part is not explained in the paper...
% - What about the SAMPLE keyword of SPARQL?
