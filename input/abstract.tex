  Sampling-based approximate query processing (S-AQP) has many
  important use-cases in RDF including computing large scale
  statistics, embeddings, join orderings, approximated aggregations,
  summaries, exploratory queries. However, current SPARQL endpoints
  have no support for S-AQP, and many queries just time-out on public
  SPARQL endpoints. In this demonstration, we present \NAME: an
  extension of Apache Jena to support S-AQP for conjunctive SPARQL
  queries relying on random walks. \NAME delivers partial random
  results along with cardinality estimation in a pay-as-you-go fashion
  with a logarithmic complexity.
