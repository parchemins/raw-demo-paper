\begin{abstract} Sampling-based approximate query processing (S-AQP) has many
  important use-cases in RDF including computing large scale
  statistics, embeddings, join orderings, approximated aggregations,
  summaries, exploratory queries. However, current SPARQL endpoints
  are not able to efficiently deliver results drawn uniformly at
  random. In this demonstration, we extended JENA to support
  efficiently sampling-based approximate query processing for core
  SPARQL queries.  we show that for a query that time-out on wikidata
  (60s) and deliver partial non-random results, we deliver in 1s
  partial random results along with an accurate cardinality estimation
  of the query.
