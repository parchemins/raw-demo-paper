%Hala: in RDF c'est bizzare
\begin{abstract}
  Sampling-based Approximate Query Processing (S-AQP) has many
  important use cases for RDF knowledge graphs, including computing large-scale
  statistics, embeddings, join orderings, approximate aggregations,
  summaries, and exploratory queries. However, current SPARQL endpoints
  have no support for S-AQP, and many queries just time out on public
  SPARQL endpoints. In this demonstration, we present \NAME: an
  extension of Apache Jena to support S-AQP for conjunctive SPARQL
  queries relying on random walks. \NAME delivers partial random
  results and cardinality estimates in a pay-as-you-go fashion.
  % with logarithmic time complexity.
