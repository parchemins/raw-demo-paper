  Public SPARQL endpoints allow anyone to execute any SPARQL
  queries. However, due to fair use policies of public SPARQL
  endpoints, there is no garantee of termination with complete
  results. Consequently, many long running queries cannot be executed
  on public SPARQL endpoints. If returning complete result in fixed time is impossible in
  the general case, it is possible to return a sample of results in
  fixed time, along with an estimation of the cardinalities of
  complete results. Sampled results can be incrementally improved
  following a pay-as-go approach. In this demo, we show that a SPARQL
  endpoint can be easily extended with a sampling interface returning
  not only sampled results but also statistics about sampled
  results. Such interface has many practical use-cases as computing
  summaries, embeddings, join orderings, approximated aggregations.
  To validate our approach, we extended JENA with a sampling interface
  and show what can be obtained with fixed time for queries that
  traditionaly time-out on public endpoints.
