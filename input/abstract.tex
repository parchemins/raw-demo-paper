  Sampling-based approximate query processing (S-AQP) has many
  important use-cases in RDF including computing large scale
  statistics, embeddings, join orderings, approximated aggregations,
  summaries, exploratory queries. However, current SPARQL endpoints
  cannot efficiently deliver results drawn uniformly at random. In
  this demonstration, we extended Apache Jena to support efficient
  S-AQP for \TODO{core} SPARQL queries. A query that times out on
  Wikidata after 60 seconds delivers partial non-random results; We
  deliver partial random results along with cardinality
  estimation in a pay-as-you-go fashion. \todo{logarithmic time complexity?}
