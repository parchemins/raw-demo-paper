How it improves processing time of embeddings over wikidata.

How it allows users to get approximate query results on wikidata
queries that would otherwise time out on public endpoints. 


\section{Demonstration Plan}

\TODO{Depending on learning time, show the learning curve.}

Basic: People see wikidata queries fail. We execute the same queries
with a same timeout on our engine. It works and provide additional
insights such as confidence interval.

\TODO{Can we provide more insight in a user interface.}

Show the actual random walks with their corresponding metadata. Maybe
show aggregated versions of these on a tree representing the query plan.
