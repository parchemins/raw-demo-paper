\section{Conclusion}

S-AQP has many important use-cases that are crucial to maintain an
eco-system of SPARQL endpoints. \NAME demonstrates how S-AQP can be
easily integrated into a representative SPARQL endpoint. As random
walks have a bounded complexity, random walks never time-out and is
not concerned by fair-use policies of public SPARQL endpoints.  In
future works, we plan to support full SPARQL queries and demonstrate
how the SPARQL standard could  evolve to integrate sampling as SQL
did with the TABLESAMPLE clause.
