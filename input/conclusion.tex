\section{Conclusion}

Sampling-based approximate query processing (S-AQP) has many important
use-cases that are crucial to maintain an eco-system of SPARQL
endpoints. \NAME demonstrates how S-AQP can be easily integrated into
a representative SPARQL endpoint. In future works, we plan to support
full SPARQL queries. We also think that the SPARQL standard should
evolve to integrate sampling as SQL did with the TABLESAMPLE clause.
