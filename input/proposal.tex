\section{\NAME: RAndom Walks for Apache Jena}
\label{sec:proposal}

\paragraph{Sampling principles.}

%\NAME is based on WanderJoin\cite{li2019wanderjoin}.
Let $Q$ be a SPARQL conjunctive query, and $J = \langle tp_1, ..., tp_n \rangle$ be
the join order to perform random walks. A random walk
$\gamma_i = \langle t_1, ..., t_n\rangle$ is computed over
an RDF graph $G$ by randomly picking $t_1$ in $\llbracket tp_1 \rrbracket_G$,
and each subsequent $t_i$ ($i > 1$) in $\llbracket t_{i-1} \bowtie tp_i \rrbracket_G$.
Once computed, the cardinality of $Q$ is estimated as in ~\cite{li2019wanderjoin}, as  the inverse probability
of sampling $\gamma_i$, i.e.,  $P(\gamma_i)^{-1}$, with $P(\gamma_i) = |\llbracket tp_1 \rrbracket_G|^{-1} \prod_{i=2}^{n}
|\llbracket t_{i-1} \bowtie tp_i \rrbracket_G|^{-1}$.
%
For instance, let us consider the query $Q_e$ and the RDF graph $G_1$
depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:random_walks_example}. Following the join order $tp_3,tp_2,tp_1$, the random walk 
$\gamma_1$ is computed as follows:

% \begin{center}
  \begin{small}
    \begin{tabular}{l|lll}
      $tp_3$ & draw  $t_1$ &$= (\textbf{A}, P641, Q3609)$ & $\in \llbracket (?x1, P641, Q3609) \rrbracket_{G_1}$ \\
      $tp_2$ & draw  $t_2$ &$= (A, P17, \textbf{D})$ & $ \in \llbracket (\textbf{A}, P17, ?x3) \rrbracket_{G_1}$  \\
      $tp_1$ & draw  $t_3$ &$= (D, P361, Q27611)$ & $\in \llbracket (\textbf{D}, P361, Q27611) \rrbracket_{G_1}$  
    \end{tabular}
  \end{small} 
% \end{center}

\noindent The cardinality of $Q_e$ is then estimated as the inverse
probability of sampling $\gamma_1$:
\begin{small}

\noindent\begin{tabular}{ll}
    $P(\gamma_1)^{-1}$  &$=  |\llbracket (?x1, P641, Q3609) \rrbracket_{G_1}| \times
                          |\llbracket (\textbf{A}, P17, ?x3) \rrbracket_{G_1}| \times
                          |\llbracket (\textbf{D}, P361,
                          Q27611) \rrbracket_{G_1}| $ \\
                      &$=  2 \times 1 \times 1 = 2$
\end{tabular}
\end{small}

\noindent Note that a random walk may fail if it becomes impossible to sample $t_i$ for
some $i \leq n$. In this case, its probability $P(\gamma_i)$ of being sampled is 0.
For instance, if $t_1 = (B, P641, Q3609)$ is picked in
$\llbracket (?x1, P641, Q3609) \rrbracket_{G_1}$
instead of $(A, P641, Q3609)$, then the random walk fails because
$\llbracket (B, P17, ?x3) \rrbracket_{G_1} = \emptyset$.
%
To improve the quality of estimates, we compute a set of $k$ random
walks $\Gamma = \langle \gamma_1, ..., \gamma_k \rangle$, and the
cardinality of $Q$ is estimated as
$|\Gamma|^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{|\Gamma|} P(\gamma_i)^{-1}$.

%\paragraph{Target audience.}
%Researchers and practitioners in need of sampling services over RDF
%knowledge graphs. \TODO{In fields.}

 We executed the query $Q_{604}$ of
 WDbench~\cite{angles2022wdbench} presented in
 Figure~\ref{fig:raw_screenshot} that searches for people with
 the same date of birth and death. $Q_{604}$ time-out on the public
 Wikidata SPARQL endpoint takes over 2 hours to complete on JENA and returns ~25M results.
%
With \NAME, the server computes random walks each time the play button is pressed until reaching  $10 000$ random walks, or $60s$ of execution
 time. By repeating the operation, results are merged iteratively in a
 pay-as-you-go fashion hence displaying more accurate
 information. Figure~\ref{fig:raw_screenshot} shows results after
 $10$ iterations executed in ~35 seconds. \NAME estimates
 the cardinality of $Q_{604}$ around $26 \pm 3$ millions of results
 and returns 1434 random results among 100k random walks.
% Hala: Figure pas lisible
% \paragraph{Web interface.}
 The bottom panel of Figure~\ref{fig:raw_screenshot} displays the
 random walks $\gamma_i$ with $P(\gamma_i))$, i.e., all displayed
 random walks failed.  The left panel presents the evolution of the
 cardinality estimate and the confidence interval when the number of
 random walks increases. As we can see, the cardinality estimate
 converges to the real cardinality.  The right panel displays the join
 order $J$ with the number of random walks that reach each triple
 pattern, i.e., for 100000 random walks launched on $quad_1$, only 1434
 reached $quad_6$. Maybe the join order chosen by JENA is not the
 best and should be corrected. This example shows how S-AQP can be
 used for exploratory queries and optimization. It is also possible to compute large-scale statistics,
 embeddings, or summaries using the same approach.


 % Yet, the bottom left figure provides an estimation
 % of the number of results over the number of random walks with
 % confidence intervals. The bottom right figure provides the estimated
 % number of intermediate results along with the number of random walks
 % that reached each triple/quad pattern.  Finally, the bottom part
 % shows both failed and succeeded random walks along with the
 % probability that they were chosen at execution time.

% \paragraph{Getting insights on timed out WDBench queries.}
% A few queries of WDBench fail to execute under the 60 seconds mark,
% providing nothing whatsoever. We execute these queries using \NAME and
% show that, with as little as 1 second, we retrieve interesting
% insights on the query plan that may help optimizers to perform their
% join ordering. We also get a rough approximation of the number of
% results that we improve by executing the query for additional seconds.
% The plotted curve converges towards the actual cardinality of the query.
