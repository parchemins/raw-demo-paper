Sampling-based Approximate Query Processing (S-AQP) has many important
use cases for RDF, including computing large-scale statistics,
embeddings, join orderings, approximate aggregations, summaries, and
exploratory queries. However, current SPARQL endpoints have no support
for S-AQP, and many queries just time out on public SPARQL
endpoints. In this demonstration, we present RAW-Jena: an extension of
Apache Jena to support S-AQP for conjunctive SPARQL queries relying on
random walks. RAW-Jena delivers partial random results and cardinality
estimates in a pay-as-you-go fashion.
