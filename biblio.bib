abstract="The Linked Data cloud has grown to become the largest knowledge base ever constructed. Its size is now turning into a major bottleneck for many applications. In order to facilitate access to this structured information, this paper proposes an automatic sampling method targeted at maximizing answer coverage for applications using SPARQL querying. The approach presented in this paper is novel: no similar RDF sampling approach exist. Additionally, the concept of creating a sample aimed at maximizing SPARQL answer coverage, is unique. We empirically show that the relevance of triples for sampling (a semantic notion) is influenced by the topology of the graph (purely structural), and can be determined without prior knowledge of the queries. Experiments show a significantly higher recall of topology based sampling methods over random and naive baseline approaches (e.g. up to 90{\%} for Open-BioMed at a sample size of 6{\%}).",

abstract="With the increasing application of Linked Open Data, assessing the quality of datasets by computing quality metrics becomes an issue of crucial importance. For large and evolving datasets, an exact, deterministic computation of the quality metrics is too time consuming or expensive. We employ probabilistic techniques such as Reservoir Sampling, Bloom Filters and Clustering Coefficient estimation for implementing a broad set of data quality metrics in an approximate but sufficiently accurate way. Our implementation is integrated in the comprehensive data quality assessment framework Luzzu. We evaluated its performance and accuracy on Linked Open Datasets of broad relevance.",

abstract="RDF dataset profiles provide a formal representation of a dataset's characteristics (features). These profiles may cover various aspects of the data represented in the dataset as well as statistical descriptors of the data distribution. In this work, we focus on the characteristic sets profile feature summarizing the characteristic sets contained in an RDF graph. As this type of feature provides detailed information on both the structure and semantics of RDF graphs, they can be very beneficial in query optimization. However, in decentralized query processing, computing them is challenging as it is difficult and/or costly to access and process all datasets. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose the concept of a profile feature estimation. We present sampling methods and projection functions to generate estimations which aim to be as similar as possible to the original characteristic sets profile feature. In our evaluation, we investigate the feasibility of the proposed methods on four RDF graphs. Our results show that samples containing {\$}{\$}0.5{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$} of the entities in the graph allow for good estimations and may be used by downstream tasks such as query plan optimization in decentralized querying.",

abstract="SPARQL property path queries provide a succinct way to write complex navigational queries over RDF knowledge graphs. However, their evaluation remains difficult as they may involve the execution of transitive closures. As a result, many property path queries just time-out when executed on public online RDF knowledge graphs. One solution to speed up their execution is to find optimal join orders. Although the join ordering problem has been extensively studied for traditional SPARQL queries, the presence of property path patterns biases existing approaches. In this paper we focus on {\$}{\$}C2RPQ{\_}{\{}UF{\}}{\$}{\$}C2RPQUFqueries (conjunctive SPARQL property path queries with UNION and FILTER), and we present a query optimizer that is able to capture the cost of {\$}{\$}C2RPQ{\_}{\{}UF{\}}{\$}{\$}C2RPQUFqueries using an appropriate cost model and a sampling-based cardinality estimator. On the latest Wikidata Query Benchmark, we empirically demonstrate that our approach finds significantly better join orders than Virtuoso and BlazeGraph.",
